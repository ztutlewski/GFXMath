The \%\%(G \textbackslash{}circ F)(\textbackslash{}vec\{X\})\%\% Math library (abbreviated G\+F\+X\+Math) is a lightweight, but powerful, data-\/oriented math library focused on the development of graphics-\/oriented applications in C++.\hypertarget{index_sec_design}{}\section{Design}\label{index_sec_design}
Given that the G\+F\+X\+Math library is designed with data in mind, much of its functionality is overloaded between two major sections\+: S\+I\+S\+D code and S\+I\+M\+D code.\hypertarget{index_sec_sisd}{}\subsection{S\+I\+S\+D}\label{index_sec_sisd}




The S\+I\+S\+D code is all standard C++, and generally does not leverage the hardware or compiler for optimizations more than is absolutely necessary, keeping the code relatively fast without sacrificing too much readability. Given that the compiler will typically optimize standard C++ operations far better than a programmer ever could anyway, this doesn\textquotesingle{}t affect the performance of the S\+I\+S\+D code much.\hypertarget{index_sec_simd}{}\subsection{S\+I\+M\+D}\label{index_sec_simd}




The S\+I\+M\+D side, on the other hand, almost exclusively utilizes intel\textregistered{} S\+S\+E intrinsics, and frequently makes use of some {\itshape very} low-\/level techniques. However, while these will somewhat reduce readability, many of the more common operations (such as absolute value, negation, etc.) have been written into helper functions. Additionally, the many of the intel\textregistered{} S\+S\+E functions have been given wrapper functions to improve their readability. For example, {\ttfamily \+\_\+mm\+\_\+mul\+\_\+ps(\+\_\+\+\_\+m128)} is wrapped in {\ttfamily Vec\+Mul(\+Sse\+Vec)}. It should be noted that almost all the functions in the S\+I\+M\+D portions are marked as {\ttfamily inline}, including the wrapper functions, and are fully defined in the header files. As well, G\+F\+X\+Math library does not make use of .inl files, or split header files for {\ttfamily inline} functions; the declarations and definitions are fully contained in the same files.
